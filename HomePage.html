        Shanghai is one of the few cities in the world evoke so much history,
        excess, glamour, mystique and exotic promise in name alone. <br /><br />
        Shanghai is home to the world's second-tallest tower and a host of other
        neck-craning colossi. But it's not all sky-scraping razzmatazz. Beyond
        the crisply cool veneer of the modern city typified by Pudong, you can
        encounter copious architectural styles.
        <br /><br />
        Beijing often hogs the limelight as China’s cultural nexus, but for a
        town of wheelers and dealers, Shanghai is surprisingly creative. Many
        art galleries are exciting, offering a window into contemporary Chinese
        concerns, while nightlife options have exploded. Acrobatics shows are
        always a tourist favourite and you might grab the chance to catch some
        Chinese opera. Shanghai’s music and club scenes are vibrant: from
        unpretentious jazz and indie venues to all-night hip-hop and
        electro-dance parties, the city swings with the best of them.
